# 🌦️ Interactive Weather App  

This project is part of my **Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**. I built a **Weather App** that fetches real-time weather data for any city and also allows users to check the weather based on their current location.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **City-Based Search** – Get instant weather updates for any location worldwide.  
✅ **Current Location Feature** – Uses geolocation to fetch real-time weather data.  
✅ **5-Day Forecast** – Provides a detailed forecast for the next five days.  
✅ **Dynamic UI Updates** – Displays weather icons, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.  
✅ **Optimized UI/UX** – Clean, responsive design for a seamless experience.  
✅ **Error Handling** – Manages invalid inputs and geolocation access denial.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – For structuring, styling, and interactivity.  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – Fetching live weather data.  
- **Geolocation API** – Retrieving user's current location.  
- **Fetch API & Async/Await** – Handling API requests and responses.  

## 🚀 What I Learned  
- **API Integration** – Fetching and displaying real-time data from OpenWeatherMap.  
- **JavaScript Asynchronous Handling** – Using `fetch()`, Promises, and `async/await`.  
- **DOM Manipulation** – Dynamically updating UI elements.  
- **Error Handling** – Managing invalid city names and geolocation permission issues.  
- **Geolocation API** – Implementing location-based weather updates.
